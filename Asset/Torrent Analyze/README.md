## DESCRIPTION:
SOS, someone is torrenting on our network. 
One of your colleagues has been using torrent to download some files on the companyâ€™s network.
Can you identify the file(s) that were downloaded? 
The file name will be the flag, like picoCTF{filename}. [Captured traffic](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/206/torrent.pcap).
## HINTS:
1. Download and open the file with a packet analyzer like [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/).
2. You may want to enable BitTorrent protocol (BT-DHT, etc.) on Wireshark. Analyze -> Enabled Protocols.
3. Try to understand peers, leechers and seeds. [Article](https://www.techworm.net/2017/03/seeds-peers-leechers-torrents-language.html).
4. The file name ends with `.iso`.
## STEPS:
